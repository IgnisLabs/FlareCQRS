Flare CQRS
==========

Flare is a small and easy to use CQRS library.  
It drives CQRS by making use of the message bus pattern, separating Queries
(interrogatory messages) from Commands (imperative messages).

This library was greatly inspired by [Messaging Flavours][] article by Mathias
Verraes.

What is CQRS?
-------------

Originated with Bertrand Meyer's _Command and Query Separation_ principle (CQS):

> It states that every method should either be a command that performs an
  action, or a query that returns data to the caller, but not both. In other
  words, asking a question should not change the answer. More formally, methods
  should return a value only if they are referentially transparent and hence
  possess no side effects.
  
So, _Command and Query Responsibility Segregation_ (CQRS):

> ... applies the CQS principle by using separate Query and Command objects to
  retrieve and modify data, respectively.

Installation
------------

Through composer:

```shell
$ composer require ignislabs/flare-cqrs
```

Usage
-----

FlareCQRS is framework-agnostic, but it's really easy to bootstrap and use.

### Bootstrapping

```php
<?php
// Instantiate the resolver:
// This will get you a new instance of the hander based on the _handler id_,
// i.e, the fully-qualified class name, or wharever identifier you might use in
// a framework container.
// By default FlareCQRS comes with a CallableResolver that will let you do this
// really easily for any framework.
$resolver = new \IgnisLabs\FlareCQRS\Handler\Resolver\CallableResolver(function($handlerId) use($app) {
    // Assuming Laravel's container
    return new $app->make($handlerId);
});

// Now instantiate the buses passing them a Locator instance

$queryBus = new \IgnisLabs\FlareCQRS\QueryBus(
    // Tell the Locator which handler corresponds to which query
    // and how to instantiate the handlers (passing in the Resolver)
    new \IgnisLabs\FlareCQRS\Handler\Locator\MapLocator($resolver, [
        GetAllTasksQuery::class => GetAllTasksHandler::class
    ])
);

$commandBus = new \IgnisLabs\FlareCQRS\CommandBus(
    // Tell the Locator which handler corresponds to which command
    // and how to instantiate the handlers (passing in the Resolver)
    new \IgnisLabs\FlareCQRS\Handler\Locator\MapLocator($resolver, [
        AddTaskCommand::class => AddTaskHandler::class
    ])
);
```

### Usage

Now you can use the buses to dispatch any message, like so:

```php
<?php
// Queries can return whatever you need, it will be encapsulated in a Result object
$result = $queryBus->dispatch(new GetAllTasksQuery('some', 'params'));
// You can call `$result->then`:
$result->then(function(TaskCollection $tasks) {
    // Do what you want with your results
    // Using `then` let's you use type-hinting
    // It can be a any `callable`, not just a closure
});
// Or just get the result right away:
$result->getResult();

// Commands do not return anything
$commandBus->dispatch(new AddTaskCommand('Task Title', 'The task description'));
```

### Message (Query & Command) classes

Your Message classes are simple DTO objects, so there are no rules or contracts
to use, they can be whatever you like.

You can, however, take advantage of the `DataAccessorTrait`. With it you can
have automatic accessor properties for your message classes. The trait defines
a `data` private property, a `get` accessor method and the `__get` magic method
so you can access the data as properties:
 
 ```php
 <?php
 
class MyMessage {
    use \IgnisLabs\FlareCQRS\Message\DataAccessorTrait;
 
    public function __construct(string $foo, int $bar) {
        $this->data = compact('foo', 'bar');
    }
}
 
$message = new MyMessage;
// Using generic `get` accessor:
$message->get('foo');
// Using the magic accessor:
$message->bar;
 ```

### Handlers

The handlers, on the other hand, must conform to the
`\IgnisLabs\FlareCQRS\Handler\MessageHandler` contract. But the contract's only
requirement is a `handle` method that will receive your command class instance.

### Middlewares

You can create middlewares to interact with the messages before they reach their
respective handlers.

Your middleware classes must implement the `\IgnisLabs\FlareCQRS\Middleware`
contract.

You can pass your middlewares globally to your buses on instantiation as the 
second parameter like so:

```php
<?php
$queryBus = new \IgnisLabs\FlareCQRS\QueryBus(
    new \IgnisLabs\FlareCQRS\Handler\Locator\MapLocator($resolver, [
        GetAllTasksQuery::class => GetAllTasksHandler::class
    ]),
    [
        new LogginMiddleware($logger)
    ]
);
```

Or you can add/replace the middlewares on a one time basis:

```php
<?php
// Add a middleware to the chain
$commandBus->addMiddleware(new LogginMiddleware($logger));
// Completely replace the middleware chain
$commandBus->middlewares([new LogginMiddleware($logger)]);
```

Buses are **immutable**, so adding or replacing middlewares on a bus will always
return a new bus instance, so any subsequent calls to your buses will not be
affected by these middleware changes.
